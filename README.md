# Data Analysis Portfolio — Main Features

This repo contains three self-contained notebooks (each in its own folder). Below are the **main features** covered in each analysis.

## 1) Titanic — Exploratory Data Analysis

* Cleaned dataset and handled missing values for key columns.
* Explored **survival relationships** by:

  * Passenger Class (Pclass)
  * Gender (Sex)
  * Age (binned/continuous)
  * Family size
* Built clear visuals (bar charts, histograms) to compare survival rates across groups.
* Summarized takeaways as simple, decision-oriented insights.

## 2) House Prices — Cleaning & Analysis

* Performed **systematic missing-value treatment** (numeric & categorical).
* Checked distributions and noted near-normal variables where relevant.
* **Feature engineering:** replaced `YearBuilt` with an easier-to-read **Age** feature.
* Computed correlations with **SalePrice** and visualized them (heatmap + interactive view).
* Highlighted the strongest numeric drivers of price with concise commentary.

## 3) Uber Trip Data — Exploratory Data Analysis

* Cleaned raw trip records and standardized datatypes (timestamps, numerics).
* Extracted time features (hour/day/month) to analyze **demand patterns**.
* Identified **peak hours & weekdays** and contrasted with off-peak periods.
* Visualized trends (time-series & heatmaps) and summarized location/activity hotspots.
* Provided a compact, data-driven overview of usage behavior.
